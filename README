vimbucket - it's vim, but with people!

Run a server and/or connect to a currently existing
vimbucket server. The server keeps a buffer of currently
typed characters. Every character you type gets sent to the
server and all clients can see all characters that are typed.
There is no backspacing, but support may be added in
the future for such a thing.

To compile: run 'make'
